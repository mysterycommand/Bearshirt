â€¦ well, that's the plan anyway. At the moment it's more of a minimalist, procedural, cave/room explorer. Use W, A, S, D or UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT arrows to move the little ball around. Hold a directional key and hit SPACE and you can pick up a block from the cave. Do that again to put it down (or whatever direction you want). You can only carry one block at a time.

Your only mission is to find the door. It's a small brownish square somewhere on the right side of the map. Have fun exploring!
